    <h2>Semantic elements</h2>
    <details>
        Semantic HTML elements are those that clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way.
        <summary>A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

            Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

                    Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.
